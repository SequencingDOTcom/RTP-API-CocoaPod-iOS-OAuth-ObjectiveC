# CocoaPods plugin for quickly adding Sequencing.com's OAuth2 and File Selector to iOS apps coded in Objective-C

=========================================
This repo contains CocoaPods plugin code for implementing Sequencing.com's OAuth2 authentication for your Objective-C iOS app so that your app can securely access [Sequencing.com's](https://sequencing.com/) API and app chains.

* oAuth flow is explained [here](https://github.com/SequencingDOTcom/OAuth2-code-with-demo)
* Example that uses this Pod is located [here](https://github.com/SequencingDOTcom/OAuth2-code-with-demo/tree/master/objective-c)

Cocoa Pod integration
======================================

You need to follow instruction below if you want to install and use OAuth logic and file selector logic in your existed or new project.

* create a new project in Xcode

* install pod (see instruction here https://cocoapods.org > getting started)
	* create Podfile in your project directory: ```$ pod init```
    * specify "sequencing-oauth-api-objc" pod parameters: ```$ pod 'sequencing-oauth-api-objc', '~> 1.0.1'```
	* install the dependency in your project: ```$ pod install```
	* always open the Xcode workspace instead of the project file: ```$ open *.xcworkspace```

* use authorization method(s)
	* add import ```#import "SQOAuth.h"```
	
	* for authorization you need to specify your application parameters in NSString format (BEFORE using authorization methods) 
		```
		static NSString *const CLIENT_ID	 = @"your CLIENT_ID here";
		static NSString *const CLIENT_SECRET = @"your CLIENT_SECRET here";
		static NSString *const REDIRECT_URI	 = @"REDIRECT_URI here";
		static NSString *const SCOPE         = @"SCOPE here";
		```    

	* register these parameters into OAuth module instance
		```
		[[SQOAuth sharedInstance] registrateApplicationParametersCliendID:CLIENT_ID ClientSecret:CLIENT_SECRET RedirectUri:REDIRECT_URI Scope:SCOPE];
		```
		
	* add import for protocols
		```
		#import "SQAuthorizationProtocol.h"
		#import "SQTokenRefreshProtocol.h"
		```
		
	* subscribe your class for these protocols
		```
		<SQAuthorizationProtocol, SQTokenRefreshProtocol>
		```
	
	* subscribe your class as delegate for such protocols
		```
		[[SQOAuth sharedInstance] setAuthorizationDelegate:self];
		[[SQOAuth sharedInstance] setRefreshTokenDelegate:self];
		```
	
	* add methods for SQAuthorizationProtocol
		```
		- (void)userIsSuccessfullyAuthorized:(SQToken *)token {
			dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
				// your code is here for successfull user authorization
			});
		}

		- (void)userIsNotAuthorized {
			dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
				// your code is here for unseccessfull user authorization
			});
		}
		```
	
	* add method for SQTokenRefreshProtocol - it is called when token is refreshed
		```
		- (void)tokenIsRefreshed:(SQToken *)updatedToken {
			// your code is here to handle refreshed token
		}
		```
	
	* you can authorize your user now (e.g. via "login" button). For authorization you can use ```authorizeUser``` method. You can get access via shared instance of SQOAuth class):
		```
		[[SQOAuth sharedInstance] authorizeUser];
		```
		
		Related method from SQAuthorizationProtocol will be called as a result
	
	* in method ```userIsSuccessfullyAuthorized``` you'll receive SQToken object, that contains following 5 properties with clear titles for usage:
		```	
		NSString *accessToken
		NSDate   *expirationDate
		NSString *tokenType
		NSString *scope
		NSString *refreshToken
		```
		
	* in method ```tokenIsRefreshed``` you'll receive updated token with the same object model.
		DO NOT OVERRIDE REFRESH_TOKEN PROPERTY for TOKEN object - it comes as null after refresh token request
	
	* for your extra needs you can always get access directly to the up-to-day token object which is stored in SQAuthResult class.
		```
		[[SQAuthResult sharedInstance] token];
		```
